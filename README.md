# TimeWeaver


## Functionality


TimeWeaver is a dedicated platform designed to simplify the organization of group meetings among students. Our solution merges the individual timetables of students, highlighting common free slots, thus making it easy to pinpoint when everyone is available. This ensures students spend more time collaborating and less time scheduling conflicts.


## Purpose


Finding a common time slot for group projects, given varied class schedules, electives, and extracurricular activities, can be challenging and time-consuming. TimeWeaver is pivotal because:


- Efficiency: It automates the process of combining timetables, removing manual comparisons.
- Visual Aid: It provides a visual representation of 'gaps' in schedules where the least number of individuals have commitments.
- Save & Share: Users can save their consolidated timetable for future reference and share it as an image with all group members, keeping everyone aligned.
